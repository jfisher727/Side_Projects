	Workout Tracker -- README.TXT ---

	This program is a GUI application for the user to track workouts.

	USAGE
	The user selects the date which the exercise was performed. Select the muscle group which the exercise resides in, choosing between Chest, Back, Abs,
Legs, Shoulders, Biceps, and Triceps. Finally the user selects the actual exercise that was performed and the number of sets which they performed of that
exercise. After the user presses the "Submit" button, the panel to the right will update with fields for "Weight" and "Reps" for the number of sets which 
the user entered previously. After filling in all of the "Weight" and "Reps" fields, the user will press "Record" button to store all of their input. 
	The user has the option to see how their workouts have progressed over time with the graph menu at the top. You have the option of displaying a line
graph of your progress over time with respect to 1RM, one rep max, or the volume with which you lifted for the workout. 
	The user also has the ability to generate a database to record all of their workout data, save the current database that they are working with, and
load another database that they can select with the GUI.
